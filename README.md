# scattering

## Description

This program calculates the scattering behaviour of a 2D beam of
particles colliding with a 2D shape. For now, the scatterer is a
stationary and rigid is defined by a Fourier series on a circle.

## Future things

A generalised scatterer that includes bubbles and lips.
Many other things that are included in `log.md`.
